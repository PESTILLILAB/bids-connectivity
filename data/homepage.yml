  title: Overview
  content: |
   The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a BRAIN initiative (R24 MH114705) community-driven standard
   meant to maximize neuroimaging data sharing, and facilitate analysis tool development. We propose to 
   extend the standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments related to both functional as 
   well as structural magnetic resonance imaging data that describe macroscopic brain connectivity estimates. 
   The focus of this proposal is to advance BIDS to describe the entire experimental workflow—from minimally 
   processed anatomical, functional and diffusion MRI data through connectivity matrices and tractometry features—in 
   service of supporting BRAIN initiative studies of large-scale connectivity of human and nonhuman brains. 
   BIDS was initially scoped to MRI data of the brain, but the standard has set up a solid infrastructure to 
   steer the community and has been extended to cover a range of other modalities (PET, EEG, MEG, ECoG). Since 
   its first announcement, BIDS has evolved to become an organized community with shared governance and a strong 
   impact well beyond the U.S. BRAIN initiative. To date, 131 individuals among faculty, students, and postdocs 
   contributed to the development of the standard and the article describing BIDS has been cited 277 times. 
   
   Current gaps exist in developing BIDS to effectively support the process of scientific results generation. This is because 
   the standard does not yet describe brain features that can be extracted from MRI data and that are routinely used 
   to perform statistical tests and complete scientific studies. These features comprise connectivity maps, structural 
   and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models as well as white matter tractograms 
   and tractometry. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally-processed data is critical 
   to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation, 
   and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. One previous project (R24 MH114705) laid the foundations 
   for the BIDS derivatives standard, ultimately leading to the existing Common Derivatives standard. However, the 
   current BIDS derivative standard does not cover advanced data derivatives that describe brain connectivity experiments. 
   
   The aim of this project is to advance the BIDS standard beyond preprocessed data to describe data products generated 
   from experiments and models fit after preprocessing. The project will deliver a community-developed standard describing 
   brain connectivity experiments. The project is 
    supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health NIMH 
    [R01-MH126699](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/wY9-gfr9wkuqjnR-lFfGwA/project-details/10253558).
    
    This 3-days workshop will bring together experts in various data modalities (MEG, EEG, PET, MRI) and data-processing methods.
    The experts will lay the foundations for prototypes of [BEPs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4/edit)
    and make proposals that will be open for feedback from the wider community of neuroscientists after the workshop.

    This workshop is sponsored by [Award R01 MH126699](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/wY9-gfr9wkuqjnR-lFfGwA/project-details/10253558) 
    from the NIH which requires to develop prototypes of the BIDS connectivity standards during the workshop. 
    Workshop participants are asked to commit their time to develop a BIDS connectivity standard during the workshop and to continue 
    developing the standard in the 2 years after the workshop by integrating a wider community feedback and developing an complete
    standard speciication with example software for testing. If you are an expert in Connectivity data and  interested in 
    participaitng in the workshop please email email [Franco Pestilli](pestilli@utexas.edu).
