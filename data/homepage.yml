  title: Overview
  content: |
    The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is community-driven standard meant to maximize neuroimaging 
    data sharing, and facilitate analysis tool development. Over the past year the standard grew tremendously. 
    BIDS was initially scoped to MRI data of the brain, but the standard has set up a solid infrastructure to
    steer the community and has been extended to cover a range of other modalities (PET, EEG, MEG, ECoG). Since
    its first announcement, BIDS has evolved to become an organized community with shared governance and a strong
    impact well beyond the U.S. BRAIN initiative. To date, 131 individuals among faculty, students, and postdocs
    contributed to the development of the standard and the article describing BIDS has been cited 277 times.
    
    Besides the success, expansion, and description of multiple data modalities, gaps still exist in developing the 
    standard to effectively support the process of scientific results reporting. This is because the standard does not 
    yet describe advanced brain features that can be derived from all these data and that are routinely used to perform statistical analysis 
    and complete scientific studies. These brain features comprise connectivity maps, structural
    and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models as well as white matter tractograms
    and tractometry. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally-processed data is critical
    to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation,
    and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. 

    The aim of the present project is to extend the BIDS standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments 
    related to macroscopic brain connectivity. The project is supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health NIMH
    [R01-MH126699](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/wY9-gfr9wkuqjnR-lFfGwA/project-details/10253558).

  title: The 2022 BIDS Connectivity Workshop
  content: |
    The 2022 BIDS Connectivity Workshop is a 3-days meeting that brings together experts in various data modalities (MEG, EEG, PET, MRI, ECoG) and data-processing methods.
    The experts will lay the foundations for prototypes of 
    [BEPs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4/edit)
    and make proposals that will then be open for feedback to the wider community of neuroscientists after the workshop. Specifically, the project and thus workshop will focus on 5 BEPs:   
    - [Diffusion Weighted Imaging derivatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQYBvToU7tUEtWMLMwXUCB_T8gebCotE1OczUpMYW60/comment)  
    - [advanced Diffusion Weighted Imaging derivatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubDQ2RhgjnfGqoeukzEkPV9YEHhfYMERrj7-3b0c2HI/comment)  
    - [Dimensionality reduction-based Networks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GTWsj0MFQedXjOaNk6H0or6IDVFyMAysrJ9I4Zmpz2E/comment)  
    - [Connectivity matrix data schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugBdUF6dhElXdj3u9vw0iWjE6f_Bibsro3ah7sRV0GA/comment)  
    - [Atlas specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxW4cARr3-EiBEcXjLpSIVidvnUSHE7yJCUY91i5TfM/comment)  
    
    [A document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wz5tkKK63P85luDr-nDsuSTEdUG6xxfLXcTGO1UFuNk/edit?usp=sharing) was created
    to allow both workshop attendees and the wider community to interact with the BIDS Connectivity Project activities.

    The 2022 BIDS Connectivity workshop is sponsored by [Award R01 MH126699](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/wY9-gfr9wkuqjnR-lFfGwA/project-details/10253558)
    from the NIH which requires to develop prototypes of the BIDS connectivity standards during the workshop.
    Workshop participants are asked to commit their time to develop a BIDS connectivity standard during the workshop and to continue
    developing the standard in the 2 years after the workshop by integrating a wider community feedback and developing an complete
    standard specification with example software for testing. If you are an expert in Connectivity data and  interested in
    participating in the workshop please email email [Franco Pestilli](pestilli@utexas.edu).
