  content: |
    Neuroimaging experiments result in complicated data that can be arranged in many
    different ways. So far there is no consensus how to organize and share data obtained
    in neuroimaging experiments. Even two researchers working in the same lab can opt
    to arrange their data in a different way. Lack of consensus (or a standard) leads
    to misunderstandings and time wasted on rearranging data or rewriting scripts expecting
    certain structure. With the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), we describe a simple
    and easy to adopt way of organizing neuroimaging and behavioral data.
